# Assets Folder

This folder stores media assets for THE LANDING.HUB page.

## Current Assets
- **copilot_image_1770855251423.jpeg** - Profile logo (currently active)

## Updating Your Profile Image
To replace the current logo with your own:

1. Upload your new image to this folder
2. Use any of these formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, or SVG
3. Recommended: Square image (200x200px minimum, higher resolution preferred)
4. Update `index.html` line 87 to reference your new file:

```html
<img src="assets/YOUR_NEW_IMAGE.jpg" alt="Profile" class="profile-img rounded-full" />
```

## Adding Future Assets
- Keep all images in this folder for clean organization
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `brand-logo.png`, `profile-photo.jpg`)
- Optimize images before uploading (compress for web to reduce load time)
